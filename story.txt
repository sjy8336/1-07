Once upon a time, there was a small village near the forest.  
In that village lived a young girl who loved stories more than anything.  
Every night, she would sit by the window and read a new story.  
Her grandmother often told her a story about a brave knight.  

One day, the girl found an old book filled with mysterious stories.  
The stories were written in a language she had never seen before.  
But she felt that every story inside the book was calling her name.  

As she kept reading the stories, strange things started happening.  
The stories began to change every time she opened the book.  
Some said the book had magical powers, born from a forgotten story.
